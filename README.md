# Clever Unicorns Flutter Template

This Flutter template will setup:
1. Default Flutter application.
1. Git ignore files to exclude unwanted files from Git tracking.
1. Github workflows for:
   * Verifying build on `push` or `pull_request` on `master` branch.
   * Verify build and automatically add build artifacts (`.apk`, `.aab`) to the Github `release` trigger.

*We have set this up for you so that you don't need to waste time on repetitive things and start working super fast...*
